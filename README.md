## Live Interview Cycle

Each live test is limited to a maximum of 30 minutes.
* **Tue, 7am: 1. Implementing a data structure**
* **Fri, 7am: 2. Solving an algorithm problem with a data structure**

## Live Interview Process
#### 1. Implementing a Data Structure

1. Explain the data structure.
2. Discuss the best and worst scenarios for using this data structure.
3. Design the data structure.
4. Explain the implementation process while coding.
5. Prove that the data structure works correctly:
	1. Describe scenarios (set input and expected output data).
	2. Write test cases.
	3. Run the tests.
	4. Debug and fix any issues.
6. Provide and receive feedback after completion.

#### 2. Problem Solving with a Data Structure

1. Explain your approach to solving the problem.
2. Describe your thought process while solving the problem.
3. Prove that your solution works correctly:
	1. Describe scenarios (set input and expected output data).
	2. Write test cases.
	3. Run the tests.
	4. Debug and fix any issues.
4. Provide and receive feedback after completion.

## Contribution Rule

#### Repository Folder Structure 

github_id/data-structure_name/ds or ps/filename.java

1. `devjohnpark/stack/ds/class_name.java`
2. `devjohnpark/stack/ps/class_name.java`

#### Commit Convention

1. `git commit -m "[Stack] implementation stack"`
2. `git commit -m "[Stack] solving problem using stack"`

#### Pull Request Rule

name, data-structure_name, ds or ps (ds:data structure/ps: problem solving)

1. `john park, stack, ds`
2. `john park, stack, ps`


#### How to Contribute?

1. `Fork` the remote repository to your repository.
2. `clone` your forked remote repository to local.
3. `add` -> `commit` (following the convention) -> `push [your forked remote repository]`.
4. Create a `pull request` to the forked remote repository.

Afterwards, the administrator of the forked remote repository will merge the changes.
